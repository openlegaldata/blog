## Bring Open Legal Data to Your Country

For the beginning on, Open Legal Data meant to be an international project. 
Despite being currently only available for Germany, we are working towards to make the project more international.
Many other countries lack transparency in their legal system.
We believe that technology can help here and are looking forward to build an international community.
An international could more easy foster the movement toward more openness in the legal sector. 
Code - especially when its Open Source - does not know any borders.
Having a bigger international community will also help the make the project more sustainable on the long run.

Thus, if the idea of having Open Legal Data for your country excites you, do not hesitate to get in touch with us.
To illustrate what needs to be done to bring Open Legal Data to your country we made up these five simple steps:


1. Contact Us: We would love to hear from you to discuss the details.
   But you can also start right away without even asking us. The code is already freely available.

2. Translate: Labels etc. must be available in your language. 
   This should not be a big deal, since we are using the [Django framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/i18n/). 
 
3. Adjust: You can easily change the templates depending on your needs. 
   For example see the [German theme repository](https://github.com/openlegaldata/oldp-de).

4. Data: Obtaining data will be probably the most difficult part.

5. Deploy:  We are happy to host your version on our server or provide help for installing it on your own infrastructure.
