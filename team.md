## Join Open Legal Data

This project is run by volunteers in their spare time. Therefore we are dependent on your support. We are constantly looking for activists, developers, lawyers, journalists, analysts and above all motivated comrades-in-arms. 
Would you like to make the rule of law more transparent together with us and open data? 
Then contact us via email at [hello@openlegaldata.io](mailto:hello@openlegaldata.io). 
Please send us court decisions, use our data, report bugs or work on new features.
