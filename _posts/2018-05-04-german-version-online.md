After weeks of hard work we finally launched the [German Open Legal Data Platform](https://de.openlegaldata.io/) which 
is at the same time the first
 version at all. It comes already with all basic features: Overview and full text of most German laws, case files from 
 the high court of Germany (BGH) and most importantly the API.

Having this first version on line and freely available, we can now collect user feedback and continue the development 
of the platform. Our next milestones are the publication of the source code on GitHub and the adding of more cases 
from other courts to cover the most import jurisdiction of Germany.
