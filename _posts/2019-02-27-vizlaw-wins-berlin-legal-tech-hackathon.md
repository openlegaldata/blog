During the last week the 2019 edition of the [Legal Tech Center](https://berlinlegal.tech/2019/) conference took place in Berlin. 
Aside the conference and as part of the [Global Legal Hackathon](https://globallegalhackathon.com/), also a hackathon was organized.
Within just a single day several teams developed prototypes in the area of legal tech and presented their results to a jury.
Team VizLaw were selected as winner by the jury. 
VizLaw won the competition with their visual exploration tool for court decisions, which heavily relies on our API
and the [citation dataset](http://openlegaldata.io/research/2019/02/19/court-decision-dataset.html).
As winner of the Berlin hackathon, VizLaw has qualified for the final round the Global Legal Hackathon 
and will present their prototype soon in New York in front of an even bigger audience.

We are proud see that other projects start using our data. 
This is what we started Open Legal Data for. If you build something cool with our API, please contact us. 
We are excited to see what else can be done with the data.
