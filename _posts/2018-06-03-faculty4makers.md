We are proud to announce that we won the faculty4makers challenge 2018 at TU Berlin! We are glad that our 
project has won your hearts.

The competition was organized by [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin for DIY-projects](https://www.eecs.tu-berlin.de/zielgruppen/presse/veranstaltungen/faculty4makers_challenge/faculty4makers_challenge_201718/) 
carried out by students in their spare time outside university. Students were encouraged to present their own 
technical, engineering or scientific initiative, creativity and scientific know-how around the topics of 
electrical engineering and computer science.

We want to promote and provide free access to legal data such as legislation and jurisdiction. 
Following the principles of the open data movement, openlegaldata.io aims to increase the transparency of the 
justice system with the help of open data. For more detailed information follow the project website or 
have a look at its source code on GitHub.
